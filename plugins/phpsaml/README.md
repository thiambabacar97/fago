# GLPI SAML SSO AUTHENTICATION

#### This is a GLPI plugin that facilitates single sign on authentication with an identity provider using the SAML 2.0 protocol.  This tool leverages the Onelogin PHP library.  Tested with ADFS 2.0+ and Google IDP

### Why SAML?

SAML is an XML-based standard for web browser single sign-on and is defined by the OASIS Security Services Technical Committee. The standard has been around since 2002, but lately it is becoming popular due its advantages:

* Usability - One-click access from portals or intranets, deep linking, password elimination and automatically renewing sessions make life easier for the user.
* Security - Based on strong digital signatures for authentication and integrity, SAML is a secure single sign-on protocol that the largest and most security conscious enterprises in the world rely on.
* Speed - SAML is fast. One browser redirect is all it takes to securely sign a user into an application.
* IT Friendly - SAML simplifies life for IT because it centralizes authentication, provides greater visibility and makes directory integration easier.
* Opportunity - B2B cloud vendor should support SAML to facilitate the integration of their product.

### Usage

Enter settings on the Plugin Page
![GLPI Settings Page](https://derrick-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Settings.png)

* Plugin Enforced = Force SSO login or allow visitors to login using internal GLPI authentication (useful for testing).
* Strict = PHPSAML setting rejects unsigned or unencrypted messages and follows SAML standard strictly, read more ![here](https://github.com/onelogin/php-saml)
* Debug = Logs to the GLPI PHP log
* JIT = Just in Time Provisioning adds the authenticated user to GLPI if it does not already exist

* SP Certificate = Your webserver certificate
* SP Certificate Key = Your webserver certificate key
* NameID = NameID required by your IdP

##### Name ID requirement
You can change the NameID that is sent from PHPSAML to the IdP or leave as unspecified.  Unspecified will work in most cases but some IdPs expect a specific NameID format.  Sending an incorrect NameID claim will result in a SAML Response error.

#### Azure AD
1. Create a new enterprise application
2. Enable SAML Authentication
3. Configuration
* Entity ID = {Your GLPI web server base URL}
* Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL) = {Your GLPI web server base URL}/plugins/phpsaml/front/acs.php

For Azure AD, the following NameID configuration is correct.  You could also use user.mail as the Source Attribute.
